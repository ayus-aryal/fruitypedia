## Fruitypedia: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Fruitypedia app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by [Jose Morales](https://josdem.io/). The source code is available on GitHub under the [Apache license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0); the app eventually will be available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en_US&gl=US).

As a software developer, I take privacy and security very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. We do not collect, store and share any data created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
